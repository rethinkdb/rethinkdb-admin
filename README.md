# rethinkdb-admin
RethinkDB Next Generation Admin UI app

## Usage (TBD)
rethinkdb-admin would be able to be installed via docker or by direct usage through the repo

## Contributing (TBD)
To start the development, you need to:

1. clone the repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run start:dev`

Later more steps could come, but not necessarily. You can develop it under any OS, but GNU/Linux based is preferred.

## Ideas

- (Auto)deploy to dockerhub
- Roadmap of tasks to finish to an alpha version (list of all features to migrate from actual admin ui)
- Wiki
- State manager (?)
- Multiuser authorization
